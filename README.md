# hello-world
This is my first repository.

Hi, my name is Adam.
I am here to show my personal projects and progression using Java.
I graduated from univeristy and decided to go straight into recruitment.
I have recently decided that is not the path I wish to take and have started to learn Java as I would like to build a career based around software development.
